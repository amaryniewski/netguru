For Mac users:

After downloading the project you should be able to run the tests.
I uploaded chromedriver and geckodriver into the project to you don't have to download it.


If you use PC instead of Mac, please replace "fullscreen()" method for "maximize()" in DriverUtils class.

I tried to not repeating myself, but there is still space to improve - as always.

For answering these questions, I also used my project for video course which I mentioned about in my resume. The code was written some time ago, thatâ€™s why more than two test cases are automated.
